# JoesFlow

<!-- badges: start -->
[![Lifecycle: experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#experimental)
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of JoesFlow is to analyze high-dimensional single cell data from flow cytometry, scRNA-seq, CITE-seq and any kind of single cell matrix data. JoesFlow utilizes novel scRNA-seq dimension reduction techniques to generate interpretable and informative visualizations that incorportate all aspects of a dataset in an unbiased manner.

## Installation

You can install the released version of JoesFlow from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("JoesFlow")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(JoesFlow)
run_app()
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:


You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
